# Block AI
The first ever chatbot to help you code in Scratch (TurboWarp/PenguinMod)
# Features
- Displays code with [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks)
- Can read the current code in the sprite you are working in
- Automatically selects the best Gemini model for you
- Stylish simple to use UI with adaptable colors

# How to use
### PenguinMod
Load it from this link: [PenguinMod with BlockAI](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html?extension=https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js)
or
Load it into an existing project using this link `https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js`
### TurboWarp
Copy the text from [here](https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js) and paste it into the extension loader window. Make sure to run it unsandboxed!

# How it works
It uses the Gemini API with a huge block of text with a lot of information regarding [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks) and how Scratch works. It then renders the output with scratchblocks and explains what it did.

# Limitations
It doesn't know much about other custom extensions. It's knowledge is limited to the Scratch block palette.

# Contributing
