# Block AI
The first ever chatbot to help you code in Scratch (TurboWarp/PenguinMod)
# Features
- Displays code with [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks)
- Can read the current code in the sprite you are working in
- Multiple Gemini models available
- Stylish simple to use UI with adaptable colors
- Compatibility with most TurboWarp forks

# How to use
### PenguinMod
Load it from this link: [PenguinMod with BlockAI](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html?extension=https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js)
or
Load it into an existing project using this link `https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js`
### TurboWarp
Copy the text from [here](https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js) and paste it into the extension loader window. MAKE SURE TO RUN IT UNSANDBOXED!

# How it works
It uses Gemini 2.0 flash with a huge block of text with a lot of information regarding [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks) and how Scratch works. It then renders the output with scratchblocks and explains what it did.

# Limitations
It will make A LOT of syntax errors. It's unavoidable. This is far from perfect in terms of logic as well. Along with that, it doesn't know much about extensions. It can't help you use extensions.
