# Block AI
The first ever chatbot to help you code in Scratch (TurboWarp/PenguinMod)

# How to use
### PenguinMod
Load it from this link: [PenguinMod with BlockAI](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html?extension=https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js)  
or  
Load it into an existing project using this link `https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js`
### TurboWarp
Copy the text from [here](https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/TheShovel/blockAI.js) and paste it into the extension loader window. MAKE SURE TO RUN IT UNSANDBOXED!

# How it works
It uses Gemini 2.0 flash with a huge block of text with a lot of information regarding [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks) and how Scratch works. It then renders the output with scratchblocks and tries to explain what it did.

# Limitations
It will make A LOT of syntax errors. It's unavoidable. This is far from perfect in terms of logic as well, and it won't improve by much because of the way it is built. Along with that, it doesn't know much about extensions. It can't help you use extensions at all.  
This is meant to be a proof of concept more than anything.
